# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is @ajhalili2006's alt account for all things multifandom multiverse. You might be reading the profile README from GitHub or GitLab, so here's some stuff I did.

## Links Directory

> Also see my RP account's [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/MFHellscapes) btw!

* **Socials**: [@MFHellscapes@twitter.com](https://twitter.com/MFHellscapes) or [@MFHellscapes@mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social/@MFHellscapes).[^2]

* **Tumblr**: [`@multifandom-hellscapes@tumblr.com`](https://tumblr.com/multifandom-hellscpaes) for the profile, full web experience at <https://multifandom.andreijiroh.eu.org>
* **In the Stack**: Go to the [Multifandom Hellscapes](https://fromthebshq.substack.com) in **The Bloody Hell PH** publication. Sometimes, I do publish Notes there too.[^1]
* [**Do Not Interact List**](https://multifandom.andreijiroh.eu.org/dni) - If you're on the list, interact at your own risk, although I don't autoban anyone unless shit happens.[^3]

[^1]: WTF is Notes? See <https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/14564821756308-Getting-started-on-Substack-Notes> and <https://on.substack.com/p/notes>
[^2]: For obvious reasons, I can't do Instagram because of the bloody real-names-only policy, although on the Facebook side of things I could do that via the new Pages experience.
[^3]: See also [my personal user manual](https://andreijiroh.eu.org/user-manual), especially [my boundaries](https://andreijiroh.eu.org/user-manual/boundaries).
